# question 2
Answer: int sum = test.add(123, 456);

In order to call the add method and store the result, you need to call it through the object test and declare a variable to store this rules out options 2 and 3. The parameters being passed into the method must be integers, which rules out option one. This leaves int sum = test.add(123, 456) 

# question 6
Answer: 0

public int add(){} does not have any parameters within the parentheses, and therefore has no parameters in its parameter list

# question 9
Answer: public -> visible by all classes, private -> visible only within the class in which its defined, default -> visible within the class in which it is defined and by classes within the same package, protected -> visible within the class in which its defined, by classes within the same package, and by subclasses of the class in which its defined

A protected class is slightly more available than a default class and therefore will not have the same answer as it, but protected is still not the same as dynamic, static, or package classes

# question 10
Answer: 't'

The value of c after running the code will be the char at index 6 of the code, and therefore will be equal to the letter t. Since it is a char, it will require single quotes and not double quotes. 't' is the answer.
